Challenge #1:

Create a function that takes two numbers as arguments and return their sum.

1 + 2 

label <assignment operator> value
label = value or an expression

a = 1
b = 2
c = a + b  -> 1 + 2 -> 3 -> c = 3

return c

Examples:
- addition(3, 2) ➞ 5
- addition(-3, -6) ➞ -9
- addition(7, 3) ➞ 10
